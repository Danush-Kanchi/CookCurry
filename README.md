# CookCurry

Cooking is the act of turning nature into the culture, which has enabled the
advent of the omnivorous human diet. 
The cultural wisdom of processing raw ingredients into delicious dishes is embodied in their cuisines. 
Recipes thus are the cultural capsules that encode elaborate cooking protocols for evoking sensory satiation as well as providing nourishment.
Today, there are a lot of recipes or cookbooks out there. There are a lot of recipe software applications and thousands of websites have recipes for everything.
Though there is now more recipe or food or kitchen information available than ever, most of it is stuck in the trappings of the old fashioned cookbook where the
user still have to flip paper pages, cannot combine multiple recipes into one meal and, unless the user have a very good memory, can seldom remember
which book had what recipe the user might want.
As the days go by, we tend to choose meals on the spur of the method, often based on what is easy or available. Our following pages make it easier to find
the recipe.
