# CookCurry

Cooking is the act of turning nature into the culture, which has enabled the
advent of the omnivorous human diet. 
The cultural wisdom of processing raw ingredients into delicious dishes is embodied in their cuisines. 
Recipes thus are the cultural capsules that encode elaborate cooking protocols for evoking sensory satiation as well as providing nourishment.

Today, there are a lot of recipes or cookbooks out there. There are a lot of recipe software applications and thousands of websites have recipes for everything.
Though there is now more recipe or food or kitchen information available than ever, most of it is stuck in the trappings of the old fashioned cookbook where the
user still have to flip paper pages, cannot combine multiple recipes into one meal and, unless the user have a very good memory, can seldom remember
which book had what recipe the user might want.
As the days go by, we tend to choose meals on the spur of the method, often based on what is easy or available. Our following pages make it easier to find
the recipe.

Our project entitled “Cook-Curry: a Recipe Database System” aims to eradicate paper
management and generate a digital management system.
The main objective of this database is to provide the users the recipe based on the recipe name
and also based on the available ingredients. It helps the user to search based on the required
cuisine, the ingredients available and hence reduces the effort required to search for a recipe.
There will be a robust database which stores all the data related to recipe based on the diet
type, region of cuisine and related information.
## On one button click we can retrieve -
• The list of all recipes based the filters provided.

• The images and the procedures of preparation of the recipe

• A link to the website for detailed information.
## Features of recipe database:
• Search by recipe : a search is performed by providing the recipe name and cuisine other
filters.

• Search by ingredients: a search is performed by providing the names of the ingredients and
filters.

The below image represents the ER diagram for the Database used.
